This fork contains modifications and enhancements to the original biosim4
codebase, developed with AI pair programming assistance.

Key modifications include:
- Modernization to C++20/23 standards
- Enhanced code structure and organization
- Comprehensive documentation and comments
- Improved build system (CMake-focused)
- Memory leak detection and fixes
- Unit testing framework integration
- Refactored animation/video generation system
- Build environment compatibility improvements
- Code convention enforcement

Development Methodology:
This fork was developed using AI-assisted pair programming techniques,
combining human architectural decisions with AI-powered code analysis,
refactoring suggestions, and implementation support.
