/**
 * @file simulator.cpp
 * @brief Main simulation loop and thread orchestration
 *
 * This file contains the core simulation engine that drives the evolutionary process.
 * It implements a three-level nested loop structure:
 * - Outer loop: Generations (epochs of evolution)
 * - Middle loop: Simulation steps within each generation
 * - Inner loop: Individual creatures (parallelized via OpenMP)
 *
 * The simulator manages four global singleton data structures:
 * - grid: 2D spatial world where creatures exist
 * - pheromones: Signal layers overlaying the grid
 * - peeps: Container of all Individual creatures
 * - imageWriter: Video frame capture system
 *
 * Thread safety is achieved through a deferred execution model where mutations
 * to shared state (movements, deaths, signal updates) are queued during parallel
 * execution and applied in single-threaded sections.
 *
 * @see simulator() for the main entry point
 * @see simulationStepOneIndividual() for per-creature execution

 * @brief Execute one simulation step for a single individual

 *
 * 1. Increment the individual's age counter
 * 2. Feed sensor inputs through the neural network (feedForward)
 * 3. Queue actions for deferred execution (executeActions)
 *
 * Actions like movement, death, and signal emission are queued rather than
 * executed immediately. This deferred execution model allows all threads to
 * treat shared data structures (grid, signals, peeps) as read-only during
 * parallel execution. Queued actions are applied in single-threaded sections
 * at the end of each simulation step.
 *
 * **Thread Safety:**
 * - `grid`: Read-only access (query occupied locations, barriers)
 * - `pheromones`: Read-only except signals.increment() at creature's location
 * - `peeps`: Read-write for this individual, read-only for others
 * - `randomUint`: Thread-local instance (seeded per-thread in parallel region)
 *
 * **Performance Note:**
 * This function is the computational hotspot of the simulator. It's called
 * population Ã— stepsPerGeneration times per generation and is parallelized
 * via OpenMP's `#pragma omp for` directive.
 *
 * @param individual Reference to the Individual struct being simulated
 * @param simulationStep Current step within generation (0 to stepsPerGeneration-1)

 * @see Individual::feedForward() for neural network execution
 * @see executeActions() for action queue processing

/**
 * @brief Main simulation loop - top-level entry point for the evolutionary simulator
 *
 * This function orchestrates the entire simulation lifecycle through a three-level
 * nested loop structure:
 *
 * **Outer Loop (Generations):**
 * - Each generation begins with a population of creatures
 * - Creatures live for a fixed number of simulation steps
 * - At generation end, selection pressure is applied (survival criteria)
 * - Survivors reproduce to create the next generation
 * - Failed generations (no survivors) restart from generation 0
 *
 * **Middle Loop (Simulation Steps):**
 * - Fixed duration per generation (stepsPerGeneration parameter)
 * - Each step: all living creatures sense, think, and queue actions
 * - Deaths occur during steps but corpses persist until generation end
 * - Step concludes with single-threaded action resolution
 *
 * **Inner Loop (Individuals):**
 * - Parallelized via OpenMP across available threads
 * - Each thread executes simulationStepOneIndividual() for assigned creatures
 * - Thread-safe through read-only data access and deferred action queues
 *
 * **Initialization Sequence:**
 * 1. Display available sensors and actions (printSensorsActions)
 * 2. Copy provided params to global g_params (for parameterMngrSingleton compatibility)
 * 3. Initialize random number generator (randomUint)
 * 4. Initialize global singletons (grid, pheromones, imageWriter, peeps)
 * 5. Create generation 0 with random genomes and placements
 *
 * **Global Data Structures:**
 * - `grid`: 2D spatial world (16-bit indices, 0=empty, 1..N=creature IDs)
 * - `pheromones`: Multi-layer signal grid (uint8 values, diffusion/fade)
 * - `peeps`: Indexed creature container (index 0 reserved, 1..population valid)
 * - `imageWriter`: Video frame capture system (synchronous mode)
 * - `g_params`: Global simulation parameters (accessed via parameterMngrSingleton)
 *
 * **Thread Architecture:**
 * - Main thread: Orchestrates loops, applies queued actions, I/O operations
 * - Worker threads: Parallel execution of simulationStepOneIndividual()
 * - Thread count: Configurable via numThreads parameter (OpenMP)
 *
 * **Video Generation:**
 * When enabled (saveVideo=true), frames are captured periodically and compiled
 * into .avi movies at generation end. See imageWriter and IMAGEWRITER_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md.
 *
 * **Genome Analysis:**
 * Sample genomes are displayed to stdout at intervals (genomeAnalysisStride).
 * Pipe output to tools/graph-nnet.py for neural network visualization.
